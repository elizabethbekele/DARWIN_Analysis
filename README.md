# DARWIN_Analysis

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's is imperative since there is currently no cure. Instead of using invasive procedures to diagnose Alzheimer's researchers have considered the idea of using handwritten tasks to measure brain activity. The DARWIN dataset refers to Diagnosis AlzheimeR With haNdwriting. This study has an extensive amount of data compared to other handwritten analyses. It contains information on 174 participants - some with Alzheimer's and some who don't have the condition, 25 handwritten tasks, and 18 metrics. The metrics are measurements coming from a Wacom's Bamboo tablet equiped with a pen. This project will look into the effectiveness of these metrics and tasks in classifying participants as either Healthy (H) or with Alzheimer's (P).

The files will be broken up into parts:

(1) Data Cleaning 

(2) Exploratory Data Analysis

(3) Machine Learning 

All insights will be included in a PowerPoint.
